## Introduction
This is a basic networking contact list managment application.

## Instructions
- [Get Started](https://ajackson57.github.io/aj-networking-contacts-frontend/)
- As a user ypu must register for an account. Once an account is created you
  login and you can display, create, edit, and delete contacts.
- [Backend Server hosted on Heroku](https://gentle-crag-17128.herokuapp.com/)

## Technologies used.
- **Styling** - The Boostrap NAV bar and basic styling were used.
- **HTML** - A table is used to display the list of contacts.
- **JavaScript** - Events from the table, butons, and the navigation bar drive
  the application.
- **Ruby on Rails** - The backend server was developed with Ruby's Rails
  framework. Ajax used on the frontend to make requests of the Rails server.

## The Devlopment Story
[Initial Schedule]()
 - **The Development Process**
 - The development process started with some rough wireframes, some user
   stories, and a quick planning outline. I divided development into feature
   groups and created a branch in Git for each group. The branches were as
   follows:

 - **Problem-Solving Strategy**
 - Initial primary strategy was to use console.log to print out information at
   specific areas in the program flow.
 - I began to use more of the debugging facilities in the DevTools. I setup
   breakpoints and stepped through the code examining values of objects as I
   stepped through.
